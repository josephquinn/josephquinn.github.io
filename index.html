			<p>
				Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at Duke University. I use quantitative and computational methods to explore 
				questions about social cognition, networks, and group processes.
				</p>
			<p>
				My primary research interests consider beliefs about status, how these beliefs emerge and change, and when they facilitate or 
				constrain opportunities for particular groups. I also study intergroup dynamics and segregation in a variety of settings, from 
				schools and neighborhoods to digital venues.
				</p>
			<p>
				Current projects of mine explore the content of teacher-student interactions after adolescents change schools in a residential 
				mobility program, the role of status characteristics in shaping the opportunities available to creatives and professionals, and 
				ways that organizational structure can facilitate meaningful intergroup contact. A portion of my research agenda involves 
				methodological projects on both the survey items and computational approaches used to measure and model networks.
				</p>
			<p>
				Before arriving at Duke, I worked as a technical researcher at MDRC in support of several large-scale program evaluations funded 
				by the Institute of Educational Sciences, the US Department of Education, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Before that,
				I taught physics at McKinley Technology High School in DC (go Trainers!) and volunteered as a research assistant at the Poverty and 
				Inequality Research Lab in Baltimore.
