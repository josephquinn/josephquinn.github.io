			<p>
				Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at Duke University. I use quantitative and computational methods to explore 
				questions about social cognition, networks, and group processes.
				</p>
			<p>
				My primary research interests consider beliefs about status, how these beliefs change, and when they facilitate or constrain 
				opportunities for particular groups. I also study intergroup dynamics and segregation in a variety of settings, from schools and 
				neighborhoods to digital and public spaces.
				</p>
			<p>
				Current projects of mine explore teacher-student interactions in secondary schools after adolescents experience significant 
				neighborhood change, the role of status characteristics in shaping opportunity structures available to cultural producers, and 
				factors influencing forgiveness of high-status actors. A portion of my research agenda involves methodological projects on 
				both the survey items and computational approaches used to measure and model networks.
				</p>
			<p>
				Before arriving at Duke I taught physics at a public high school in DC, and worked as a technical researcher at MDRC in 
				support of several national program evaluations funded by the Institute of Educational Sciences, the U.S. Department of 
				Education, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. I also supported projects for the Poverty and Inequality Research 
				Lab in Baltimore, and wrote programs for social science lab groups at Johns Hopkins and Yale.
