			<p>
				Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at Duke University. I use quantitative and computational methods to explore 
				questions about social cognition, networks, and group processes.
				</p>
			<p>
				My primary research interests consider beliefs about status, how these beliefs change, and when they facilitate or constrain 
				opportunities for particular groups. I also study intergroup dynamics and segregation in a variety of settings, from schools and 
				neighborhoods to digital venues.
				</p>
			<p>
				Current projects of mine explore teacher-student interactions in secondary schools after adolescents change schools in a 
				residential mobility program, the role of status characteristics in shaping the opportunities available to creatives
				and professionals, and ways that organizational structure can facilitate meaningful intergroup contact. A portion of my research 
				agenda involves methodological projects on both the survey items and computational approaches used to measure and model networks.
				</p>
			<p>
				Before arriving at Duke I taught physics at McKinley Technology High School in DC (go Tech!), and worked as a technical 
				researcher at MDRC in support of several large-scale program evaluations funded by the Institute of Educational Sciences, the 
				US Department of Education, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. I also supported projects for the Poverty and 
				Inequality Research Lab in Baltimore, and wrote programs for social science lab groups at Johns Hopkins and Yale.
