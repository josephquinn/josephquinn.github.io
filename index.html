				I am an Assistant Professor of Sociology at The University of South Carolina, where I use quantitative and computational
				methods to explore two broad questions: how social psychological and cognitive mechanisms combine with network structures to
				(1) shape peoples' emotions about and behaviors toward members of different groups, and (2) recreate or mitigate macro-level
				social inequalities.
			</p>
			<p>
				My research considers beliefs about group identity and status, when these beliefs emerge and change, and how they reproduce or
				attenuate inequality and social stratification in society. I study processes related to these interests through agent-based
				simulations, online surveys and experiments, and field-based research partnerships with organizations. The methods I deploy in much
				of my ongoing work involve experimental manipulations of network structure and composition, which I leverage to explore the causal
				implications of social structure in belief formation, behavioral decisions, and downstream network dynamics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Current projects of mine assess how a substantial environmental shock accompanied cultural belief change about certain occupations,
				the effect of repeated exchange in different network structures on cooperation, emotion, and trust amongst actors with different
				social identities, and how manipulating aspects of organizational structure might affect interactions between members of different groups
				in ways that attenuate segregation. A portion of my ongoing research also explores both the survey items and computational approaches
				used to measure and model networks.
			</p>
			<p>
				I got my PhD in sociology at Duke University, specializing in network methods and social psychology. Before that, I worked as a technical
				researcher at MDRC in support of several large-scale program evaluations funded by the Institute of Educational Sciences, the US Department
				of Education, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. And before that, I taught physics and coached soccer at McKinley Technology High
				School in DC (go Trainers!) and volunteered as a research assistant at the Poverty and Inequality Research Lab in Baltimore.
