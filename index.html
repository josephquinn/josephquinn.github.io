				Hi! Iâ€™m a sociologist who uses quantitative and computational methods to explore two broad questions: how social psychological and 
				cognitive mechanisms combine with network structures to (1) shape individual-level emotions and behaviors toward members of different 
				groups and (2) recreate or mitigate macro-level social inequalities.
			</p>
			<p>
				My research considers beliefs about group identity and status, when these beliefs emerge and change, and how they reproduce or 
				attenuate inequality and social stratification in society. I study processes related to these interests through agent-based simulations, 
				online surveys and experiments, and field-based research partnerships with organizations. The methods I deploy in much of my ongoing 
				work involve experimental manipulations of network structure and composition, which I leverage to explore the causal implications of 
				social structure in belief formation, behavioral decisions, and downstream network dynamics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Current projects of mine assess how a substantial environmental shock accompanied cultural belief change about occupations, the effect 
				of repeated exchange in different network structures on cooperation, emotion, and trust amongst actors with different social identities,
				and how manipulating aspects of organizational structure can affect prosocial behavior between groups and attenuate homophily. A 
				portion of my ongoing research also explores both the survey items and computational approaches used to measure and model networks.
			</p>
			<p>
				I got my PhD in sociology at Duke University. Before that, I worked as a technical researcher at MDRC in support of several 
				large-scale program evaluations funded by the Institute of Educational Sciences, the US Department of Education, and the Bill and 
				Melinda Gates Foundation. Before that, I taught physics at McKinley Technology High School in DC (go Trainers!) and volunteered as a 
				research assistant at the Poverty and Inequality Research Lab in Baltimore.
