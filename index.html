			<p>
				Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at Duke University, where I use quantitative and computational methods to explore 
				two broad questions: how social cognition and network structures (1) shape emotions and behaviors toward members of different groups 
				and (2) recreate or mitigate social inequalities.
				</p>
			<p>
				My primary research interests consider beliefs about group identity and status, when these beliefs emerge and change, and how they 
				reproduce or attenuate inequality and social stratification in society. I study processes related to these interests through 
				agent-based simulations, online surveys and experiments, and field-based research partnerships with organizations.
				</p>
			<p>
				Current projects of mine explore how a substantial environmental shock shaped Americans' beliefs about essential and non-essential 
				occupations, the effect of repeated exchange in networks on cooperation and trust amongst actors with different social identities, 
				and how manipulating organizational structure can facilitate prosocial behavior between groups and attenuate homophily. A portion 
				of my ongoing research also explores both the survey items and computational approaches used to measure and model networks.
				</p>
			<p>
				Before arriving at Duke, I worked as a technical researcher at MDRC in support of several large-scale program evaluations funded 
				by the Institute of Educational Sciences, the US Department of Education, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Before that,
				I taught physics at McKinley Technology High School in DC (go Trainers!) and volunteered as a research assistant at the Poverty and 
				Inequality Research Lab in Baltimore.
